# Soil Moisture Detector
This project(made using TINKERCAD) uses an **Arduino UNO**, a soil moisture detector and other basic circuit components to show 
the moisture level in the soil being tested.

- If the soil is **wet**, the system shows "WET" and remains silent.
- If the soil is **dry**, the system shows "DRY", LED blinks rapidly and then activates the  buzzer.

### Components
- Arduino UNO
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- LED
- Buzzer
- Resistors
- Wires
